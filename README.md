# Rust Resources

This is YALORR:  Yet Another List of Rust Resources

## Learning Rust

## Database and Serialization

[Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) is an orm and query builder for Rust.


## Rust for Web Development

* A good starting point is [Are We Web Yet?](https://www.arewewebyet.org/).  See also this ]comparison of Rust Web Frameworks](https://github.com/flosse/rust-web-framework-comparison).  Apparenty the most popular framework is [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/) (not Rocket) -- but see the next point.  Also see the caveat [here](https://actix.rs/docs/whatis)

* [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) is a [well regarded](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/11ddacc/rust_for_web_development_an_honest_evaluation/) tokio web application framework.  Considered more on the flax spectrum.  Actix-web and Rocket may be more full featured.  Axum has several [examples](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/main/examples) to start from.

* [Askama](https://github.com/djc/askama) is a Jinja-basead template engine.

* [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) is a front-end client (Wasm) framework reminiscent of JSX.
